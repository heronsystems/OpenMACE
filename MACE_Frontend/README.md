# MACE GUI

GUI built with ReactJS

## Work in progress

### Developing

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn start:app` to run the app

### Running Tests

Jest is set up to run the test suite. You can use one of the following commands to test:

- `yarn test` - This runs the test suite one time
- `yarn test:watch` This sets up a watcher and re-runs the test suite on each change
- `yarn test:coverage` This runs the test suite but also checks code coverage and prints to the `coverage` directory
